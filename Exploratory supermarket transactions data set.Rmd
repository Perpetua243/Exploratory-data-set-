## THIS IS AN EXPLORATRORY DATA SET TO TEST MY KNOWLEDGE IN R

## WE WILL BE TESTING FOR SALES TRENDS,CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR,TOTAL REVENUE OVER TIME USING THE SUPERMARKET TRANSACTION DATA SET.

## LOAD THE TIDYVERSE PACKAGE INTO R

library(tidyverse)

```


```{r}
## import data set
## The data set was in xlsx so i had to convert to csv using microsoft excel in the "save AS part" before i could import it here

SupermarketTransactions <- read.csv(file.choose())
```


```{r}
View(SupermarketTransactions)
```


```{r}
## check for the structure of the data set

str(SupermarketTransactions)
```


```{r}
## Display the number of records in the data set both rows and columns
nrow(SupermarketTransactions)
ncol(SupermarketTransactions)
```
```{r}
## check for any missing data
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(SupermarketTransactions))
print(missing_values)

```
```{r}
## View the first few rows in the dataset
head(SupermarketTransactions)
```



```{r}
## check for any missing data
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(SupermarketTransactions))
print(missing_values)

```


```{r}
## Q1 WHAT IS THE SUMAMARY STATISTICS (MEAN,MEDIAN,MAX ETC) FOR ANNUAL INCOME AND CHILDREN
summary(SupermarketTransactions$Annual.Income)

summary(SupermarketTransactions$Children)
```


```{r}
## Q2 HOW MANY CUSTOMERS ARE "NOT" HOMEOWNERS 
SupermarketTransactions %>%
  filter(Homeowner =="N") %>%  ## where N stand for not home owners according to the dataset
  summarise(Homeowner = n())
```


```{r}
## Q3 ### SHOW ALL THE CUSTOMERS THAT HAS MORE THAN 2 CHILDREN AND THE REVENUE GENERATED

glimpse(SupermarketTransactions)
SupermarketTransactions <- SupermarketTransactions %>%
  mutate(Revenue = as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9.-]", "", Revenue))) #change revenue which is a character vector to  numeric so that summarize and sum function will work

  group_by(State.or.Province) %>%
  summarise(TotalRevenue =sum(Revenue))
```



```{r}
## Q5 SHOW THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS PER CUSTOMER
